# Helii 3D for Wii

This is a 3D reworking of my Helii homebrew game for the Wii console. Like the
2D counterpart, this game was developed a few years ago and doesn't have many
features (or any audio at all).

## Installation

Copy the compiled boot.dol, meta.xml, and icon.png files to a directory named
/apps/helii3d on your SD card or USB storage device.

## Usage/Controls

* Use the *A* button to start and to fly
* Use the *+* button to reset after you've crashed
* Use the *HOME* button to exit
